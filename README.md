  ## DESCRIPTION
 This application is a light-hearted burger tracking application with a simple premise: you are in search of the best burger and want to keep track of the ones you have had and the ones you are still planning to find, make, or consume. Users are able to add burgers to the list of "Burgers I Plan to Eat" and from there to "Burgers I have Eaten." Once a burger has been eaten, it can be deleted from the list.
